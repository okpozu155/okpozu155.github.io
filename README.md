Welcome to my playground

Here I'll be posting links to a few of my projects that I find time to post to Github. There is no criteria or preferenceâ€”just any work of mine that I feel like keeping or showing to the world.

Here are links to some repositories that I have (They are very few, but everyone, however great they are today, started somewhere somehow):

    Expenses Calculator: This is an application built with the Python library Streamlit and MongoDB database. View on GitHub
    Image Identifier: A Dockerized application that utilizes the ViLT (Vision-and-Language Transformer) model, specifically ViltProcessor and ViltForQuestionAnswering, to process both images and text together. View on GitHub
    Real-time Wall Clock: This project creates a real-time wall clock using Python's turtle graphics module. The clock features a circular face, hour markers, and moving hour, minute, and second hands that update every second to reflect the current time. View on GitHub
    Wall Clock Simulation: This project creates a real-time Wall Clock using Python's turtle graphics module. View on GitHub
